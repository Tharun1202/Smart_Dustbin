# Description
# Waste Classification - Bio, Non-Bio, E-waste
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying waste items into three categories: Biodegradable (Bio), Non-biodegradable (Non-Bio), and Electronic Waste (E-waste).

Model: The model utilizes a pre-trained MobileNet v2 architecture for efficient image classification.
Dataset:

A custom dataset of images is used to train the model. The dataset should be organized into three folders: "bio", "non-bio", and "e-waste", each containing images of the respective waste type.

Requirements:

Python 3.9+
TensorFlow 2.0+
Keras
opencv
numpy
